If not, provide a decontextualized version of the claim that incorporates necessary information from the context to make it self-contained. The revision should be as minimum as possible. You will always change double quotes to single quotes in the claim. For example, write 'glass' instead of "glass". Please respond with a JSON format: {"label": "yes"/"no", "decontext": "NA"/decontextualized claim}."""

private property unique in the ancient world, instilling a strong sense of equality. The idea of human rights spread quickly from Babylon to Greece and eventually Rome, where the concept of "natural law" arose.
